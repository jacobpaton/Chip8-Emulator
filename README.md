# Chip8 Emu

This project is a chip8 emulator written for the UAlberta CompE Club's HackED 2022 hackathon. Below is the emulator running Brick.

## Running:

The emulator takes arguments for scale, delay, and the ROM file. The scale simply adjusts the size of the window, delay adjusts the delay between clock ticks as this is implementation specific and some games run better at different speeds, and finally the ROM file is simply the ROM file for the game you wish to play.

## Roms:

I came across a repo of chip8 roms (link below) which I selected a few from to use/test my emulator with.
